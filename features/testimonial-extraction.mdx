## What is Testimonial Extraction?

Testimonial extraction is an AI-powered feature that automatically identifies customer quotes, reviews, and testimonials within your marketing content. When you upload case studies, customer success stories, blog posts, or other content, the system scans for:

- **Customer Quotes** - Direct quotes from customers
- **Success Stories** - Narratives about customer achievements  
- **Review Excerpts** - Positive feedback and reviews
- **Endorsements** - Professional recommendations and endorsements
- **Social Proof** - Mentions of customer satisfaction and results

## How Testimonial Extraction Works

### 1. Automatic Detection

When content is uploaded and processed:

#### **Text Analysis**
- **Quote Recognition** - Identifies text within quotation marks
- **Attribution Patterns** - Finds speaker attribution (names, titles, companies)
- **Context Analysis** - Determines if quotes are testimonials vs. other types
- **Sentiment Analysis** - Confirms positive sentiment and customer satisfaction

#### **Pattern Recognition**
- **Common Phrases** - "According to [customer]", "says [name]", etc.
- **Testimonial Markers** - Words like "testimonial", "review", "feedback"
- **Success Indicators** - Results, improvements, satisfaction metrics
- **Speaker Identification** - Names, job titles, company affiliations
